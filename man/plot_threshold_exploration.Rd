\description{
Make a plot to explore threshold values.

\details{
All TSSs mapping methods produce spurious TSSs. For the most part, these spurious 
reads TSSs to be weak and somewhat uniformly distributed throughout promoters and
gene bodies. This means that this background can be mitigated by requiring a 
minimum read threshold for a TSS to be considered in downstream analyses.

This plotting function generates a line plot, where the x-axis is the naive read threshold
  and the y-axis is the proportion of TSSs within annotated gene/transcript promoters.
Additionally, the point color represents the absolute number of genes with at least 1 surviving
  TSS after filtering.
'max_threshold' controls the maximum threshold value explored,
  and 'steps' is the value that is used to increment between 1 and 'max_threshold'.

At a certain threshold there are diminishing returns,
  where an increase in threshold results in little increase in promoter-proximal fraction,
  but a precipitous loss in number of genes with a TSS.
A threshold should be chosen that balances these two competing metrics.
For STRIPE-seq, we have found that a threshold of 3 often provides an appropriate balance between
  a high promoter-proximal fraction (>= 0.8) and the number of unique genes or
  transcripts with at least one unique TSS.
