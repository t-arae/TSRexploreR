\usage{
ordering(..., .samples = NULL, .aggr_fun = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Variables to order by.
Wrap varaible name in desc() for descending order (like in dplyr::arrange).}

\item{.samples}{Names of samples to order by aggregate score.}

\item{.aggr_fun}{If more than one sample is selected feature values
are aggregated using this function.}
}
\value{
A list of ordering parameters to be passed to the 'data_ordering' argument
  of 'conditionals'.
}
\description{
This is a companion function to 'conditionals' that allows the
  specification of variables to order data by for plotting.

Columns to order by should be specified by names/symbols and not characters.
To sort by a variable in descending order, wrap the variable name in the 'desc' function.
By default ordering is calculated based on the aggregate value (based on '.aggr_fun')
  of the variable accross all samples.
If '.samples' is specified, only the given samples will be used for aggregate
  calculation and ordering.
